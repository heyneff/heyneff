- 👋 Hi, I’m @heyneff
- 👀 I’m interested in art and technology, especially where the two meet.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web3 and NFTs across various chains, programmatic generative art, how to be a good parent.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on art where digital technology plays a role: NFTs, plotter art, AR, etc.
